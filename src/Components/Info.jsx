      <h2>Hi. I'm David Gabrielyan, backend developer with experience of 3 years. In first months of my career I was
        full-stack developer, but I became more and more convinced that mostly I love backend development and started
        to learn deeply Node JS and devops. But 3 days ago (this was written on February 2021) I investigated Electron JS
        and I was very curious about learning that tool. So, this is my first project on Electron JS and I hope that this
        is not the last one. Hope you'll enjoy this. Thanks !
